### About Me

Hi there â€” I'm Jason ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in teaching and mechanical engineering. I'm an experienced programmer who focuses on usability and writing clean, reusable code. I love solving challenging problems and figuring out complex systems.

I develop with JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, but I enjoy learning new languages. I've developed front-end apps with React and back-end apps with Django and Node+Express. I've even developed a mobile app (Android/iOS) with React Native + Expo. Before I entered web development, I programmed with MATLAB/Simulink, C/C++, Fortran, and Java for research and school. I also taught MATLAB to engineering students.

Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, gardening, cooking, running, and hiking with my partner and our dog. I also enjoy learning new programming and markup languages on my own â€” because I'm a nerd ðŸ¤“
